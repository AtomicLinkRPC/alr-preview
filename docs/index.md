The documentation is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of ALR, from a high-level overview to deep technical details.

-   **[Overview](./overview.md)**: A high-level introduction to ALR, its goals, and key features. Start here to get a feel for what ALR is all about.

-   **[User Guide](./user-guide.md)**: A practical guide with step-by-step instructions and examples to help you understand how to build your own ALR applications.

-   **[Examples](./examples.md)**: A collection of code examples demonstrating various features of ALR, from basic "Hello World" to advanced concepts like service discovery and peer-to-peer communication.

-   **[Technical Documentation](./technical.md)**: A deep dive into the architecture and design principles of ALR, including the compiler, schema negotiation, serialization, and threading model.

-   **[API Reference](./api-reference.md)**: A detailed reference for all public classes, methods, and types in the ALR framework.

-   **[Benchmarks](./benchmarks.md)**: A performance comparison between ALR and gRPC, showcasing ALR's significant speed advantages with detailed analysis and charts.

-   **[Promotional Brief](./promotional.md)**: A summary of ALR's value proposition, targeting executives and stakeholders who may not be familiar with the technical details.

-   **[Comprehensive Guide](./atomic-link-rpc.md)**: A single document that combines the most important information from all other documents into a comprehensive resource.

-   **[Raw Results (localhost)](./assets/results/raw_results_localhost.md)**: Raw performance results from a subset of tests used during ALR development, using loopback.
 
-   **[Raw Results (remote)](./assets/results/raw_results_remote.md)**: Raw performance results from a subset of tests used during ALR development, using a physical 2.5Gbps Ethernet connection between two physical hosts.
